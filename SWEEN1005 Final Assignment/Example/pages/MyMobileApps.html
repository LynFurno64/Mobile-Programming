      <p>The apps presented hear were made using the Native App application, but the are more types of
      applications to make apps with.</p>
      <h3>Native App</h3>
      <p>Native apps are built specifically for a mobile device’s operating system (OS). Thus, you can have native Android mobile apps or native iOS apps, not to mention all the other platforms and devices. Because they’re built for just one platform, you cannot mix and match – say, use a Blackberry app on an Android phone or use an iOS app on a Windows phone.
      Native apps are coded using a variety of programming languages. Some examples include: Java, Kotlin, Python, Swift, Objective-C, C++, and React.</p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Native apps live on the device and are accessed through icons on the device home screen.</li>
        <li>Native apps are installed through an application store.</li>
        <li>They are developed specifically for one platform, and can take full advantage of all the device features — they can use the camera, the GPS, the accelerometer, the compass, the list of contacts, and so on..</li>
        <li>Native apps can use the device’s notification system and can work offline.</li>
        <li>They can also incorporate gestures (either standard operating-system gestures or new, app-defined gestures).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mobile Web App</h3>
      <p>Web apps behave similarly to native apps but are accessed via a web browser on your mobile device. They’re not standalone apps in the sense of having to download and install code into your device. They’re actually responsive websites that adapt its user interface to the device the user is on. In fact, when you come across the option to “install” a web app, it often simply bookmarks the website URL on your device.
      Web apps are designed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and similar programming languages used for web work.</p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile-specific site: Optimized for mobile devices.</li>
        <li>Responsive site: re-orients or arranges itself for mobile devices.</li>
        <li>Web apps are not real applications.</li>
        <li>They are really websites that, in many ways, look and feel like native applications.</li>
        <li>They are not implemented as real apps are.</li>
        <li>They are run by a browser and typically written in HTML5.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hybrid App</h3>
      <p>These are web apps that look and feel like native apps. They might have a home screen app icon, responsive design, fast performance, even be able to function offline, but they’re really web apps made to look native.
      Hybrid apps use a mixture of web technologies and native APIs. They’re developed using: Ionic, Objective C, Swift, HTML5, and others.</p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Loads content from the web but provides users with an “app-like” interface.</li>
        <li>Are part native apps, part web apps. (Because of that, many people incorrectly call them “web apps”).</li>
        <li>Like native apps, they live in an app store and can take advantage of the many device features available.</li>
        <li>Like web apps, they rely on HTML being rendered in a browser, with the caveat that the browser is embedded within the app.</li>
        <li>They allow crossplatform development and thus significantly reduce development costs: that is, the same HTML code components can be reused on different mobile operating systems.</li>
      </ul>
